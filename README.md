## To do

- Style all pages

- Add link back to main page

- Style main page better (maybe e.g. background color, remove some drop shadow, change images on links)

- Some Bristol Data Science Logo to replace favicon

- Scope: maybe the website is not just for year 1 students, but all undergrad students?
